# Shit Is Hot

## Install

Install [Node.jsÂ® and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if they are not already on your machine. `brew install node` is recommended on macOS.

```
npm install
```

## Start

```
npm run start
```

The run script `start` executes `ng serve` with `open` option.

The `ng serve` command launches the server, watches your files, and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files.

Using the `--open` (or just `-o`) option will automatically open your browser on `[http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)`.

## Deploy

This project is hosted on GitHub Pages and uses [angular-cli-ghpages](https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages) to publish it.

```
npm run deploy
```

The run script `deploy` executes `ng build` with `prod` environment, base-href `shitishot` (change it if your repository name is different) and disabled output hashing.

## Scripts

```json
"scripts": {
  "ng": "ng",
  "start": "ng serve --open",
  "deploy": "ng build --prod --base-href \"/shitishot/\" --output-hashing=none && ngh",
  "lint": "ng lint"
}
```
